* Description:  This repository will be used to post information about LAPIS Semiconductor's 16 bit Microcontroller line.  As sample projects are developed for the 16bit MCU Lineup, this page will be updated with links to those projects
* Developer: USDC Applications Engineering Team, ROHM Semiconductor
* Repository Generated: February 2016

### LAPIS 16 Bit MCU Overview
* The ML620400 and ML620500 series CMOS microcontrollers utilize LAPIS Semiconductor's original 16bit RISC U16 Core to achieve superior performance. 
* The U16 Core is instruction-compatible with the U8 Core and offers parallel processing using a 3-stage pipeline architecture to enable efficient instruction execution with one instruction per clock cycle. 
* This series leverages low power technology utilized in 8bit U8 Core MCUs to improve processing power and provide high performance operation (16MHz Max.) while maintaining ultra-low current consumption (0.45μA at Halt, < 250μA/MHz operation). Additional features include wide operating voltage (1.8V to 5.5V) and temperature (-40℃ to +85℃) ranges, ensuring support for a variety of applications.
* A number of peripheral functions are also built in, such as a successive approximation A/D converter that supports key detection and capacitive touch switches, an RC oscillation type 24bit A/D converter ideal for temperature and humidity measurement, multiple serial ports (i.e. I2C, UART, SPI), and Flash memory that enables onboard writing.
